Grid g = Grid();
vector<int> m = g.generateMaze();
int maze[28][33];
for(int i=0; i<28; i++){
	for(int j=0; j<33; j++){
		arr[i][j] = maze[33*i+j];
	}
}

//Now you have maze (28x33) stored in maze.text, as well as in maze[][]
//Now maze.text has only the map, while maze[][] array is populated with coins
//0 denotes empty, 1 denotes wall
//2 denotes P, 3 denotes G
//6 denotes coin, 7 denotes big coins(max 6)

//also generates image of maze and saves as maze.png
