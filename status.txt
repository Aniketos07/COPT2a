Status - Game runs for 2 players with same keyboard but in an IDE.

We couldn't use linux because of unavailability of free linux virtual machine software on one partner's device and hence Makefile does not work properly.

How to Launch game?

1) Create a project in any IDE example XCode or CodeBlocks.
2) Add the Pacman master files to that project.
3) Link the libraries and include paths for SDL 2.0, SDL_mixer 2.0, SDL_image 2.0, SDL_ttf 2.0
4) Build and run the project
