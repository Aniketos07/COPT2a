}

//Now you have maze (28x33) stored in maze.text, as well as in maze[][]
//Now maze.text has only the map, while maze[][] array is populated with coins
//0 denotes empty, 1 denotes wall
//2 denotes ghost only wall, 3 denotes player only wall
//4 denotes player spawn point, 5 denotes ghost spawn point
//6 denotes coin, 7 denotes big coins(max 8)

//added file that takes maze.txt and generates image of maze - notworking yet
//need organization of tiles and work on grid - remove pen and other such problems
