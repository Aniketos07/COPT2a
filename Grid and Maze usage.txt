Grid g = Grid();
vector<int> m = g.generateMaze();
int maze[28][33];
for(int i=0; i<28; i++){
	for(int j=0; j<33; j++){
		arr[i][j] = maze[33*i+j];
	}
}

//Now you have maze (28x33) stored in maze.text, as well as in maze[][]
//0 denotes empty, 1 denotes wall
//2 denotes ghost only wall, 3 denotes player only wall
//4 denotes player spawn point, 5 denotes ghost spawn point

To add - file that takes maze.txt and generates image of maze, populated with big coin and small coins
